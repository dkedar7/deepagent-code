"""A generic ``interrupt(value)`` resumes with the RAW user value, not the
tool-review ``{"decisions": [...]}`` envelope (gh #99).

#82 / #95 fixed DISPLAYING a generic ``interrupt(...)`` payload. This is the next
gap: the value the CLI RESUMED the graph with was ALWAYS ``{"decisions": [...]}``,
regardless of what the interrupt asked for. So the canonical LangGraph "collect
input from a human" pattern — ``name = interrupt("What is your name?")`` — got
``{"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}`` back and produced the visibly wrong
``Hello, {'decisions': [{'type': 'approve'}]}!``.

The fix branches the RESUME on the same signal #82/#95 use to RENDER: a deepagents
tool-review interrupt (dict keyed ``action``) keeps the ``{"decisions": [...]}``
envelope; a generic/scalar ``interrupt(value)`` resumes with the raw value the user
gives, UNWRAPPED.
